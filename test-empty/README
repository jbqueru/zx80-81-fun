This code finds the comment at line 256, converts it in place from
hex to binary, and executes it.

In turn, that code decode the comment from line 4 (at a fixed address)
from hex into binary at address $4000, and executes it.

That code stored in line 4 displays a blank screen, doing so without
relying on any ROM code (not even the interrupt handler)

PRIVACY:
This code does not collect or process any personal data.
It also does not store or transmit any such data, obviously by not
having such data to start with, but also by running on hardware
that does not offer such capabilities in a straightforward way and
by not attempting to create such capabilities from either the
original hardware or modified/extended versions of that hardware.
There is therefore no need to obtain any consent related to personal
data, nor are there any requirements around access, restriction, and
deletion of personal data.

CYBERSECURITY:
This code runs on hardware that is not designed to offer any
connectivity, direct or indirect, to any device or network.
Should the hardware be modified/extended to attempt to offer such
connectivity, the code makes no attempt to use that functionality.

BUILD PROCESS:
Build the assembly files with z80asm, dump them to hex with hd,
and type the output into the relevant comments in the ZX80.
Save the ZX80 file, which is the final binary.

TESTING:
Run the code in the ZEsarUX emulator.
